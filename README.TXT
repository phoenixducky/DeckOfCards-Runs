This Project was originaly made in BlueJ and contains 3 programs with different concepts
The first is the DeckOfCards class with Card and Driver along with it. It is supposed to be a program that mimics a deck of cards, the driver class tests the function of the Classes.
The second is EveryRun, which marks in parenthesis every run( 2 or more numbers in a row) in a list of 20 randomly generated numbers from 1-6
The third is LongestRun, which marks the longest run in the list of 20 randomly generated numbers 1-6

PLEASE view the java files and test them out however you would like to, but i used blueJ in wrriting them so there may be files that you should ignore like package.bluej, unless you are going to test this on blueJ.
